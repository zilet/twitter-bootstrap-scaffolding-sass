# Twitter Bootstrap Scaffolding Sass

This is an experimental Grails project using Twitter Bootstrap for scaffolded views.
It utilises great Sass CSS extensions and Compass CSS authoring framework to help kickstart projects.


## Installation

Just clone the project and use it as a template for starting your own. 
Sass resources are located at compass-style folder. When you run 'compass watch' insite this folder you will get css resources compiled inside web-app/css

## Thanks to

Based on the idea from Rob Fletchers [twitter-bootstrap-scaffolding](https://github.com/robfle[tcher/twitter-bootstrap-scaffolding), but with the idea to include all needed assets to have an easy project kickstart template.
